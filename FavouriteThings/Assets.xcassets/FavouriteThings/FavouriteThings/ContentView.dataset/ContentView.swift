I think that a big step in me actually thinking that my dream was possible was when I qualifyied for Team Canada for my boat back in 2017. Looking back at it this is only a small step in my sailing journey but it really inspired me to keep working hard to become the best sailor and athlete that I can be. At the moment its difficult to keep up with my training being away at school. Last year I started coaching sailing, I think that this is not only a way for me to share my knowledge but also learn form it as well. I think that teaching gives you a new perspective on the sport and I have a better understanding which has improved my sailing since I started coaching. I also try to participate in other athletics to keep me in shape but more importantly to have fun.")
